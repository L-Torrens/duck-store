## Future updates
The store aims to continuously update and add to the collection of ducks on jumpers with JS added.

### Struggles
Mostly CSS related, practicing with grids and flexboxes coexisting and the differences between them took time to understand properly. Images within flexboxes proved to take some fiddling to get right, as well as elements taking more space in the grid than they were assigned.
